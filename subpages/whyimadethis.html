                            <p>
								Full disclosure - first things first, I made this site for a class. I don't think that diminishes its value, though - I stand behind everything I've said.
								Beyond that, I made this out of passion - these are, as I think I've made it clear, issues and annoyances that personally effect me. I'd like to see them talked about, and I'd like to see them resolved.
								Aside from *that*, I made this site to experiment and learn - I've been programming for a while, and have wanted to try my hand with <div title="A term referring to programming interfaces for non-technical individuals/users to interact with"><u>Front-End Development</u></div> for a while. I wouldn't consider this the most amazing showing - there's certainly a lot, structurally, that I'd do different were I to do this again - but I can absolutely say I got a lot out of it. Maybe it's a bit ironic that this was for a writing class, yet the thing I learned the most of was programming - but hey, that's language too!
