							<h1 class="major">Why - and how - I made This Site!</h1>
							<span class="image fit"></span>
                            <p>
								Full disclosure - first things first, I made this site for a class. I don't think that diminishes its value, though - I stand behind everything I've said. <br>
								Beyond that, I made this out of passion - these are, as I think I've made it clear, issues and annoyances that personally effect me. I'd like to see them talked about, and I'd like to see them resolved. <br>
								Aside from *that*, I made this site to experiment and learn - I've been programming for a while, and have wanted to try my hand with <a title="A term referring to programming interfaces for non-technical individuals/users to interact with">Front-End Development</a> for a while. 
								I wouldn't consider this the most amazing showing - there's certainly a lot, structurally, that I'd do different were I to do this again - but I can absolutely say I got a lot out of it. Maybe it's a bit ironic that this was for a writing class, yet the thing I learned the most of was programming - but hey, that's language too!
							</p>
							Onto <em>how</em> I made the site - it might've been hinted by the above reflection, but I wanted to go into this project by making things at a fairly deep/thorough level. This site, what you're reading right now, wasn't made using any sort of website builder tool - I wrote it with raw code! With that in mind, my main tools (alongside a picture example of them) are: 
							<div class="row">
								<div class="column">
									<h2>HTML</h2>
									Technically, this is what every site runs on - as you're using website builders like Wix or Canva, the website builder is, in the background, automatically generating the necessary html for you. <br>
									Still, since I was writing it by hand, I felt that it was at least worth noting - and perhaps interesting to the viewer.

								</div>
								<div class="column">
									<h2>JavaScript</h2>
									Any of the fancy effects this site had (primarily, the implementation of the "site swipes" gimmick I devised) were programmed in JavaScript! This took a lot of time to figure out, and wouldn't be possible in the first place on any sort of website builder.
								  <img src="/sources/jslook.png" style="width:100%">
								</div>
								<div class="column">
									<h2>Git</h2>
									The infamous (among programming circles) version control manager. As the saying goes, "you either use git, or you are one."<br>
									Git allows me to save constant backups of my work without flooding my hard drive with copies of the same thing. It'd be a bit out of scope to explain how it works, but I can certainly emphasize how helpful it's been for backing up, restoring, and synchronizing my work across multiple devices. <br>
									If you'd like to look at my GitHub repository (a public archive of my work), it's available <a href="https://github.com/Korimer/fixmealswipes">here</a>!
								  <img src="/sources/gitlook.png" style="width:100%">
								</div>
								<div class="column">
									<h2>DaVinci Resolve</h2>
									A wonderful video editor. It's, in my eyes, far more complex than what was necessary (I likely would have chosen a different tool were I to re-attempt this project), but it was if nothing else, sufficient.
