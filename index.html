               <h3>THE SWIPE SYSTEM IS UNUSABLE!</h3>
               <p>No! Thousands of students go day by day perfectly fine with swipes. That's not because they're insane or good at accepting bad circumstances, it's because meal swipes at least <b>work</b>.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
               <h3>The Swipe System should be improved!</h3>
               <p>Absolutely! Something working doesn't mean that you can't improve it. As a proud student and a prouder Ram, I care about CSU! It's because of that that I want to see CSU at its <b>best</b>, not just in a passable state.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
               <h3>I just wanted to complain!</h3>
               <p>Not at all! I firmly believe these are legitamate issues with the system, and I want to see them addressed. If these were trivial or inconsequential, I wouldn't be putting in the effort to make a site of this calibre!</p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
               <h3>I wanted to spread awareness!</h3>
               <p>Precisely! The purpose of this site is to raise awareness of what I consider some problems to be. You don't have to agree with me on every point, but I'd hope I've at least provided knowledge on the system for those who weren't aware of it, or provided an engaging perspective for those who are.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
               <h3>It's all hopeless!</h3>
               <p>Certainly not! in my eyes, there's very clear and actionable solutions - allowing swipes the flexibility to be used anywhere, and allowing you to use at least more than two in a single period makes sense.
                  Furthermore, I understand that there's more complexities to the system than what's immediately obvious. Any change would have to go through CSU's Housing and Dining department - it's not just a matter of administration being evil for no reason.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
               <h3>I'd like to get a discussion started!</h3>
               <p>Correct! I understand that especially with the complexities that come with such an influential system, change needs to be deliberate and cautious. I can't pretend to know the interworkings of absolutely everything to do with swipes, nor can I pretend to have a perfect solution to the issues with them. rather, I'd hope to get discussion started by providing *a* solution. I'm certain there exist better ones - and more than anything, I'd like to see work to find them.
