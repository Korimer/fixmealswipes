    <span class="wc-kicker wc-sans wc-blue">Welcome to the skeleton of my site!</span>
    
    <p>Since I'm doing this via an html editor, I've got a <strong>crazy</strong> amount of flexibility!</p>
    
    <p>For the moment, the following video is permanently embedded...<p>
    
    
    <iframe width="500" height="600"
      src="https://youtube.com/embed/3FBxsWwrweY">
    </iframe>
    
    
    <p>
      But in the future, I could have it pop up with the press of a <button type="button">Button</button>, 
      or when you <span title="FYI, I intend to fix up the video, too. I'm just not quite sure how to capture this problem in real life... maybe one of the GrubHub terminals?"><u>Hover</u></span> over something!
    <p>
    
    <p>The <em>main</em> points I'd like to discuss are:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/mealperiodssuck">Meal periods make no sense</a></li>
      <li><a href="/earlycutoffssuck">Weekly cutoffs make no sense</a></li>
      <li><a href="/wecouldbebetter">We're doing it worse than other colleges</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Other points of discussion would be the limitations of where you're allowed to use swipes, and how the "swipe" system works as a whole.</br>
