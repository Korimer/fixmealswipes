							<span class="image fit"></span>
							<div>
								Sound absurd? It is! The school I (and presumably you) are going to is intentionally trying to waste our money. <br>
								Meal Swipes are designed in such a way that it's incredibly easy to fall into a situation where you simply can't spend all of them, and thus have to leave some unused. <br>
								Take the weekly resets - most other colleges will offer swipes on a *monthly* basis, rather than a weekly one. Say you've got a series of events you're going to one week, so you end up eating off campus or for free - you'd inevitably end up with surplus swipes.
								In another college, this'd be no issue whatsoever - resetting swipes monthly means that you can adapt to inevitable fluctuations in your own spending. As a college kid, it's nothing out of the ordinary to miss a meal or two, just as it's entirely normal to have some days where I could go for a midday snack. <br>
								Were we given a set number of swipes per <b>month</b> rather than per <b>week</b>, as it is in other colleges, those fluctuations would balance out. However, at CSU alone, missing a meal means that unless you can find a sparse moment to spend the swipe you saved, it simply dissappears. <br>
								According to the offical CSU Housing & Dining FAQ page, 
								<blockquote cite="https://housing.colostate.edu/dining/faqs/">
									Without the ability to plan budgets at the beginning of the year and plan for staff, food costs, facility improvements, etc. we would have to raise meal plan rates.
								</blockquote>
								Interesting, considering that a monthly meal plan would, as discussed above, serve to make spending less volatile - and thus more condusive to planning. <br>
								The only way that <em>should</em> make a difference to pre-existing plans is if current budgeting relies upon students wasting swipes - in which case, I'd still prefer a monthly plan, just one with more flexibility. <br>
								This brings me to my next point - There should absolutely be more plans offered, or more flexibility among resident meal plans. Choosing between 15 or 19 meals a week is <em>barely</em> a productive choice, but it's the only choice CSU provides.
								Limiting students to a just a few set plans means we'll inevitably have to choose the plan that provide *more* swipes than we need, since the alternative is taking a plan that provides too few meals and going hungry. 
								Once again, the design of the system centers around students failing to or being left unable to make the most of their swipes - something I think is, at a baseline level, a very poor look for a school. <br>
