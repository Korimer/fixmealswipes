    <p>If you're viewing this page, it means that you MANUALLY typed in a BAD LINK!!!!!!!!!.</p>
    <p>Or, I'm just bad at web design, and made a mistake somewhere...</p>
    <p>Either way, the point is that you're not supposed to see this page! Why not return to the <a href="/index">Home Page</a>?</p>
