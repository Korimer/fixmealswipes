  <span class="wc-kicker wc-sans wc-blue">Limiting how many meals you can spend sucks!</span>
    In this segment, I intend to discuss the extremely arbitrary "meal period" system, which (slightly simplified) disallows <br>
    individuals from spending more than two swipes ($20, at most) every 2 to 5 hours.
    <br><br>
    In the more complete site, I'll have an optional seperate page (or popup!) explaining the system in more detail. <br>
    Regardless, this is a source of countless frustrations - <br>
    For one thing, I'd ask you to imagine your grocery bill from one day of shopping, 
    then consider <em>just how many seperate trips<em> that would necessitate were you paying with swipes.
